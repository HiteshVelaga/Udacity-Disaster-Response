 The project aim is to build a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model to categorize messages on a real time basis.

This project is divided in the following key sections:

1. Processing data, building an ETL pipeline to extract data from source, clean the data and save them in a SQLite DB
2. Build a machine learning pipeline to train the which can classify text message in various categories
3. Run a web app which can show model results in real time

### Executing Program:
1. You can run the following commands in the project's directory to set up the database, train model and save the model.

    - To run ETL pipeline to clean data and store the processed data in the database
        `python data/process_data.py data/disaster_messages.csv data/disaster_categories.csv data/disaster_response_db.db`
    - To run the ML pipeline that loads data from DB, trains classifier and saves the classifier as a pickle file
        `python models/train_classifier.py data/disaster_response_db.db models/classifier.pkl`

2. Run the following command in the app's directory to run your web app.
    `python run.py`
